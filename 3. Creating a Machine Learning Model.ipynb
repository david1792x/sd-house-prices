To do this, we separate our data into numerical and categorical features, which will be treated differently by our preprocessing pipeline with the help of a scikit-learn ColumnTransformer. The numerical features will be passed through unchanged, since we will use a tree-based model (XGBoost) that does not require feature scaling (standarization), and the only thing we need to do is encode our categorical data using One-Hot encoding. We encode the home type and city variables to finish our preprocessor transformer."

This errors are calculated across all price ranges, so they are most notable in high value homes, as we will see further on. The R² value is one of the most important metrics for quantifying our model performance, and it describes how much of the variance in the price can be attributed to the predictor variables that our model used.
