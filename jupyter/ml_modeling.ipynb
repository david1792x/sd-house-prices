To do this, we separate our data into numerical and categorical features, which will be treated differently by our preprocessing pipeline with the help of a scikit-learn ColumnTransformer. The numerical features will be passed through unchanged, since we will use a tree-based model (XGBoost) that does not require feature scaling (standarization), and the only thing we need to do is encode our categorical data using One-Hot encoding. We encode the home type and city variables to finish our preprocessor transformer."

    "The mean absolute error (MAE) shows the mean difference between actual and predicted price, while the root mean squared error (RMSE) shows the square root of the differences of the squared values (penalizes large differences). We can see that the mean of the cross validated errors are \\\\$146,226 for the mean absolute error, and \\\\$248,083 for the mean squared error. This errors are calculated across all price ranges, so they are most notable in high value homes, as we will see further on. The R² value is one of the most important metrics for quantifying our model performance, and it describes how much of the variance in the price can be attributed to the predictor variables that our model used. In this case, R² is 0.8634, which tells us that our model is capable of explaining 86.34% of the variance in house price, which is pretty high. The average error determines how far the prediction is from the actual price across all listings, and in this case the mean error is 14.12% with a standard deviation of 0.25% (13.87% to 14.37%)."
